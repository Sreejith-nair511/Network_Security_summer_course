CGEP 
Beginner’s Guide to Security, Networking, and Web Exploits

🧠 SECTION 1: BASIC CONCEPTS IN SECURITY
🔒 What is Cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. It ensures:
•	Confidentiality (data is private)
•	Integrity (data is unaltered)
•	Availability (data is accessible when needed)
📌 These are called the CIA Triad, the core of cybersecurity.

🌐 SECTION 2: NETWORKING BASICS
📦 What is a Network?
A network is a group of connected devices (computers, routers, etc.) that share data.
🌉 The Network Stack: OSI & TCP/IP Model
Layer	OSI Model	TCP/IP Equivalent	Description
7	Application	Application	HTTP, FTP, DNS
6	Presentation	—	Data formatting
5	Session	—	Session control
4	Transport	Transport	TCP, UDP
3	Network	Internet	IP
2	Data Link	Network Access	Ethernet
1	Physical	—	Cables, signals
🔄 Encapsulation
As data moves down the stack, each layer adds a header:

CopyEdit
App Data → TCP Header → IP Header → Ethernet Header
📌 At the receiver's end, this process is decapsulation (headers are removed).

🔌 Protocols You Must Know
•	IP (Internet Protocol): Routes packets across networks.
•	TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Reliable, connection-oriented.
•	UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Fast, connectionless, no guarantee.
•	HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol): Web page communication.
•	ARP (Address Resolution Protocol): Maps IP → MAC.
________________________________________
🧰 SECTION 3: TOOLS YOU MUST MASTER
🐧 Linux (Kali/Ubuntu/WSL)
Learn commands like:
ifconfig, ping, netstat, tcpdump, iptables, ssh
🧪 Wireshark
A GUI tool for packet sniffing – see every bit flowing through your network.
🐍 Scapy (Python-based)
Use this to create, send, and analyze custom packets.
python
CopyEdit
from scapy.all import *
send(IP(dst="1.2.3.4")/ICMP())
🐳 Docker
A lightweight container for running isolated apps. Example:


docker run -it kalilinux/kali-rolling

🚀 SECTION 4: NETWORK ATTACKS AND EXPLOITS
🧑‍💻 ARP Spoofing (MITM Attack)
•	You trick a machine into thinking your MAC address belongs to the router.
•	Used in Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks.
Tool: arpspoof, ettercap
<br>
________________________________________
🌊 UDP Attacks
UDP = no handshake = easy to flood.
Example: UDP Flood → Overwhelm a system with junk packets.
<br>
________________________________________
🔓 TCP Hijacking
Attacker injects packets mid-session.
•	Predicts TCP sequence numbers.
•	Spoofs source IP.
<br>
________________________________________
🌐 SECTION 5: WEB TECHNOLOGIES & VULNERABILITIES
🌍 How the Web Works
1.	You type example.com.
2.	Your browser sends an HTTP request.
3.	Server replies with an HTTP response (HTML, CSS, JS).
🔐 Cookies & Sessions
•	Cookies: Small data saved by browsers to track sessions.
•	Attackers can steal or forge them for unauthorized access.
<br>
________________________________________
🦠 XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
Injecting JavaScript into web pages.
Types:
•	Stored XSS: Stored in DB, triggers for every user.
•	Reflected XSS: Comes from the URL or request.
•	DOM XSS: Exploits browser-side JavaScript.
🛠️ Example:

<script>alert('Hacked')</script>
<br>
________________________________________
🕸️ CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery)
Tricks user into performing an action they didn’t intend.
🛠️ Example:

<img src="http://bank.com/transfer?amount=1000&to=attacker">
<br>
________________________________________
🔥 SECTION 6: FIREWALLS, VPNs, AND PACKET FILTERING
🧱 What is a Firewall?
A firewall blocks/filters network traffic based on rules.
🔥 iptables (Linux Firewall)

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP
Blocks incoming HTTP traffic.
<br>
________________________________________
🕳️ VPNs & Tunneling
•	VPN: Secure private tunnel over public network.
•	TUN interface: IP-based tunnel (Layer 3)
•	TAP interface: Ethernet frame-based tunnel (Layer 2)
<br>

💣 SECTION 7: BUFFER OVERFLOW & OS SECURITY
🔍 Memory Layout

| Stack      | 🡅 Local Variables, Return Address |
| Heap       | 🡇 Dynamic Memory (malloc)         |
| Data       | Initialized Global Variables       |
| Text       | Code Instructions (Read-only)      |
📛 Buffer Overflow
•	Occurs when data exceeds a buffer’s size.
•	Overwrites return address → attacker can execute shellcode.
🛠️ Write a vulnerable C program:

char buf[10];
gets(buf); // Never use gets!
<br>
________________________________________
🔐 SECTION 8: CRYPTOGRAPHY
🔐 Symmetric Encryption
•	Same key for encryption & decryption.
•	Fast, used in AES, DES.
🔐 Asymmetric Encryption
•	Public key to encrypt, private key to decrypt.
•	Used in RSA, SSH, SSL.
🔐 Hashing
•	One-way conversion (e.g., password → hash).
•	Common: SHA256, MD5 (deprecated).
<br>

🎭 SECTION 9: WEB EXPLOITS WRAP-UP
 Clickjacking
Hiding a malicious UI behind a legit one using <iframe> overlays.
 AI + Security
AI is used for:
•	Detecting phishing
•	Traffic analysis
•	Malware detection
•	Threat prediction
